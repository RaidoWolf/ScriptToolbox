ScriptToolbox
=============

Random scripts and scripting projects that I've made for various purposes.
Basically anything that I decided was too small a project to get its own
separate repository.

### Installation ###

This is a "script toolbox" of mine, more or less a place to keep track of little
standalone scripts. As such, there is no formal installation process. You just
put the files wherever you need. For bash and python scripts, you can put them
in your executable search path. For PHP scripts, you can put them in any
web-accessible directory on a web server with PHP.
