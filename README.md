========

Random useful PHP scripts that can be used standalone or implemented into other PHP projects.

dig.php - a basic form script that allows you to enter a domain name, and the server on which the script resides will perform a DNS lookup (hence "dig"), and return the results as a plain array, preceded by a convenient permalink that can be used to share a particular lookup.
