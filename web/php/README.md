PHPTools
========

Random useful PHP scripts that can be used standalone or implemented into other PHP projects.

418.php - all this does is issue the elusive HTTP error code 418 (look it up if you're unfamiliar)
base64.php - a simple tool to encode/decode base64 data
dig.php - a basic form script that allows you to enter a domain name, and the server on which the script resides will perform a DNS lookup (hence "dig"), and return the results as a plain array
invert_hex.php - a simple tool to invert hexadecimal values (useful for inverting hex color codes, which inverts the color)
myip.php - a simple tool to display the client's IP address
quad.php - a simple (and currently partially broken) tool to solve quadratic equations
rgb_to_hex - a simple tool to convert 24-bit RGB values into 24-bit hex color codes
translate_nato.php - a simple tool to translate a basic text string into NATO phoenetic code
