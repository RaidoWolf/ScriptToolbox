### Script Kiddie Bullshit ###

I pulled these files from a hard drive that I was using back in the days of my high school
computer repair class (circa 2012). They're here for their historic hilarity. None of these
are really useful. Two of them are harmless pranks, and two of them are slightly more harmful
pranks. All of them are poorly-written batch scripts. Don't judge me for what I did so long
ago. Enjoy! :)
